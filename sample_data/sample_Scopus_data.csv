1,Lipid storage myopathy due to late-onset multiple Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency with novel mutations in ETFDH: A case report,"Background: Lipid storage myopathy (LSM) is an autosomal recessive inherited lipid and amino metabolic disorder with great clinical heterogeneity. Variations in the electron transfer flavoprotein dehydrogenase (ETFDH) gene cause multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD), and have a manifestation of LSM. Muscle biopsy helps clarify the diagnosis of LSM, and next-generation sequencing (NGS) can be useful in identifying genomic mutation sites. The diagnosis of MADD contributes to targeted therapy. Case presentation: We report on a teenager who appeared to have muscle weakness and exercise intolerance at the onset. Before the referral to our hospital, he was unsuccessfully treated with glucocorticoid for suspected polymyositis. The next-generation sequencing of the proband and his parents revealed heterozygous variations, c.365G>A (p.G122D) inherited from the father, c.176-194_176-193del, and c.832-316C>T inherited from the mother in the ETFDH gene. The tandem mass spectrometry identified the mutations to be pathogenic. However, his parents and his younger sister who were detected with a mutation of c.365G>A presented no clinical symptoms. This indicates that the combination of the three compound heterozygous mutations in ETFDH is significant. After MADD was diagnosed, a dramatic clinical recovery and biochemical improvement presented as riboflavin was given to the patient across a week, which further confirmed the diagnosis of MADD. Conclusion: Our observations extend the spectrum of ETFDH variants in Chinese the population and reinforce the role of NGS in diagnosis of MADD. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment of LSM lead to great clinical efficacy and avoid some lethal complications.

2,Comparison of different insulin resistance surrogates to predict hyperuricemia among U.S. non-diabetic adults,"Purpose: Although it has been well-acknowledged that insulin resistance (IR) plays a critical role in the development of hyperuricemia (HU), specific relationship between IR and HU in non-diabetic patients remains rarely studied, and there is still no large-scale research regarding this issue. This study aims to explore the association between triglyceride glucose (TyG), TyG with body mass index (TyG-BMI), the ratio of triglycerides divided by high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (TG/HDL-C), metabolic score for insulin resistance (METS-IR), and the risk of HU in non-diabetic patients in The United States of America. Patients and methods: Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) enrolling a representative population aged ≥18-year-old were included to calculate these four indexes. Logistic regression analysis was applied to describe their associations and calculate odds ratios (OR) while the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve was utilized to assess the prediction ability of these four indexes. Results: A total of 7,743 people (3,806 males and 3,937 females, mean age: 45.17 ± 17.10 years old) were included in this study, among whom 32.18% suffered from HU. After adjustment for sex, age, ethnicity, education background, smoking status, drinking status, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), metabolic equivalent values (METs), total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and estimated glomerular filtration rate, it showed that all four indexes were closely related to HU. Compared with the lowest quartile, OR of the highest quartile of these four indicators for HU were as following respectively: TyG: 5.61 (95% CI: 4.29–7.32); TyG-BMI: 7.15 (95% CI: 5.56–9.20); TG/HDL-C: 4.42 (95% CI: 3.49–5.60); METS-IR: 7.84 (95% CI: 6.07–10.13). TyG, TyG-BMI, TG/HDL-C and METS-IR had moderate discrimination ability for HU, with an AUC value of 0.66 (95% CI: 0.65–0.68), 0.67 (95% CI: 0.65-0.68), 0.68 (95% CI: 0.67-0.69) and 0.68 (95% CI: 0.66–0.69) respectively. Each index showed better prediction ability for HU risk in females than in males. Conclusion: It was found that the risk of HU was positively associated with the elevation of TyG, TyG-BMI, TG/HDL-C and METS-IR in a large-scale population of U.S., and TyG-BMI and METS-IR have a better ability to identify HU in both genders.

3,Is early onset androgenetic alopecia related to hyperuricemia? A case control study,"Introduction and Aim: Early onset androgenetic alopecia (AGA) ensues before age of 35 years and develops stage 3 in Hamilton-Norwood classification. AGA is more noticeable in males. Early onset AGA has been linked to hyperuricemia (a metabolic disorder characterised by elevated levels of serum uric acid) but has been explored inadequately. Hyperuricemia (HU) corroborates with the presence of hypertension, obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Given the above and lack of data in this context, a study in this regard was necessary. This study was intended to relate the prevalence of HU and level of serum uric acid (SUA) levels in patients of early onset AGA versus matched controls and determine correlation between the severity of alopecia and serum uric acid and between the SUA and age (secondary objectives). Materials and Methods: Each patient was evaluated by taking history, clinical examination and laboratory investigation. Results: The groups were not different from each other with respect to age (p=0.5). The SUA in the AGA patient group was greater than in the control group; however the difference was not statistically significant. (p=0.2). AGA patients were found to have higher number of hyperuricemics as compared to the control group (Chi square test P=0.03, Odds ratio=0.39). There was no correlation between the severity of alopecia or the age of the subject with SUA. Conclusion: Our study found that men who have early onset AGA tend to have higher serum uric acid levels; also, hyperuricemics are commoner in patients who have early onset AGA than in controls. © 2022, Indian Association of Biomedical Scientists.

4,The relationship between uric acid and total femur bone mineral density in hypertensive and non-hypertensive populations,"Objective: This study aimed to explore the association between uric acid (UA) and total femur bone mineral density (BMD) in hypertensive and non-hypertensive groups. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 13,108 participants in the NHANES database, including 4,679 hypertensive and 8,429 non-hypertensive subjects. A weighted multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to explore the association between UA and total femur BMD. Results: In the hypertensive group, the relationship between UA and total femur BMD was positive [β, 3.02 (95% CI, -0.44 to 6.48), p = 0.0962). In the non-hypertensive group, the association was significantly positive [β, 5.64 (95% CI, 2.06–9.22), p = 0.0038]. In gender-stratified analysis, UA was analyzed as a continuous variable and a categorical variable (quartile). The significantly positive association was present in both the hypertensive male group [β, 5.10 (95% CI, 0.98–9.21), p for trend = 0.0042] and non-hypertensive male group [β, 10.63 (95% CI, 6.32–14.94), p for trend = 0.0001]. A smooth curve fitting showed that in the hypertensive male group, the relationship between UA and total femur BMD was an inverted U-shaped curve. In the hypertensive female group, the relationship was basically negative. In the non-hypertensive population, the relationship between UA and total femur BMD was an inverted U curve in both men and women. Conclusion: In the hypertensive male group, the association between UA and total femur BMD was an inverted U-shaped curve. As to women, the relationship was basically negative. In the non-hypertensive group, the association between UA and total femur BMD was an inverted U-shaped curve in different genders.

5,Identification of prediagnostic metabolites associated with prostate cancer risk by untargeted mass spectrometry-based metabolomics: A case-control study nested in the Northern Sweden Health and Disease Study,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common cancer form in males in many European and American countries, but there are still open questions regarding its etiology. Untargeted metabolomics can produce an unbiased global metabolic profile, with the opportunity for uncovering new plasma metabolites prospectively associated with risk of PCa, providing insights into disease etiology. We conducted a prospective untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) metabolomics analysis using prediagnostic fasting plasma samples from 752 PCa case-control pairs nested within the Northern Sweden Health and Disease Study (NSHDS). The pairs were matched by age, BMI, and sample storage time. Discriminating features were identified by a combination of orthogonal projection to latent structures-effect projections (OPLS-EP) and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. Their prospective associations with PCa risk were investigated by conditional logistic regression. Subgroup analyses based on stratification by disease aggressiveness and baseline age were also conducted. Various free fatty acids and phospholipids were positively associated with overall risk of PCa and in various stratification subgroups. Aromatic amino acids were positively associated with overall risk of PCa. Uric acid was positively, and glucose negatively, associated with risk of PCa in the older subgroup. This is the largest untargeted LC-MS based metabolomics study to date on plasma metabolites prospectively associated with risk of developing PCa. Different subgroups of disease aggressiveness and baseline age showed different associations with metabolites. The findings suggest that shifts in plasma concentrations of metabolites in lipid, aromatic amino acid, and glucose metabolism are associated with risk of developing PCa during the following two decades. © 2022 The Authors.

6,"Predictive value of novel inflammatory markers platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio in arterial stiffness in patients with diabetes: A propensity score–matched analysis","Background: Increased arterial stiffness is common in patients with diabetes, and inflammation is one of the main causes of increased arterial stiffness. Platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR) are novel inflammatory markers that are reproducible, widely available, and easy to measure, and are associated with low costs. This study sought to investigate the predictive value of these novel inflammatory markers in patients with diabetes having arterial stiffness. Methods: We retrospectively included inpatients with diabetes mellitus from the Endocrinology Department of the Chengdu Fifth People’s Hospital from June 2021 to May 2022 and collected data on their general information, biochemical indicators, and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV). After propensity matching, the risk relationship between PLR, NLR, and MLR and arterial stiffness was assessed in the recruited patients. Results: A total of 882 hospitalized patients with diabetes were included in this study and categorized into the low baPWV (507 cases) or high baPWV group (375 cases) based on the baPWV. After propensity matching, there were 180 patients in all in the high and low baPWV groups. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that high PLR, NLR, and MLR were independently associated with an increased risk of arterial stiffness in patients with diabetes. In the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the NLR area under the curve (AUC) was 0.7194 (sensitivity = 84.4%, specificity = 51.1%) when distinguishing low baPWV and high baPWV in patients with diabetes, which was higher than that for PLR AUC (0.6477) and MLR AUC (0.6479), and the combined diagnosis for AUC. Conclusions: NLR was superior to PLR, and MLR and combined diagnosis have certain predictive values that indicate the increase in arterial stiffness in patients with diabetes. These predictive values can help with the early identification of increased arterial stiffness in patients with diabetes.

7,Uric acid and metabolic syndrome: Findings from national health and nutrition examination survey,"Introduction: Hyperuricemia commonly associated with Gout has been proposed as an independent risk factor for Metabolic Syndrome (MetS). Objective: The purpose of the study was to determine if there is a relationship between hyperuricemia and MetS. Methods: An analysis of cross-sectional data was conducted using the 2013–2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) datasets. Sample weights were assigned by NHANES researchers to each participant allowing researchers to generalize results to all non-institutionalized United States (US) civilians. The analysis included 6,432 individuals, which were representative of 94,729,059 US citizens. Results: Pearson’s correlations, chi-square tests, and logistic regression equations were calculated to determine the association between hyperuricemia and MetS. In an unadjusted regression analysis, individuals with hyperuricemia (above 7.0 mg/dL in males and 6.0 mg/dL in females) were 3.19 times more likely to have MetS compared to those with normal uric acid (UA) levels. When controlling for various confounding variables those with hyperuricemia were 1.89 and 1.34 times more likely to have MetS than those with normal UA levels in two additional logistic regression models. Conclusion: In this large cross-sectional study, hyperuricemia was found to be associated with MetS. Additional analyses that controlled for various risk factors previously identified as predictive of MetS still demonstrated hyperuricemia independently associated with MetS. The results of this study suggest a need to understand the metabolic pathways of UA more clearly to further explain the contribution to MetS. Additional research should include prospective clinical trials assessing the effects of UA and the control of UA on MetS and concomitant medical outcomes.

8,Pulmonary sarcoidosis: A novel sequelae of drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms: A case report,"BACKGROUND Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome is an uncommon yet serious adverse drug hypersensitivity reaction with the presentations including rash, fever, lymphadenopathy, and internal organ involvement. Sarcoidosis is a systematic granulomatous disease with unknown etiology. We herein report a case of pulmonary sarcoidosis secondary to allopurinol-induced DRESS. CASE SUMMARY A 37-year-old man with a history of hyperuricemia was treated with allopurinol for three weeks at a total dose of 7000 milligrams before developing symptoms including anorexia, fever, erythematous rash, and elevated transaminase. The patient was diagnosed with DRESS and was treated with prednisone for 6 mo until all the symptoms completely resolved. Three months later, the patient presented again because of a progressively worsening dry cough. His chest computed tomography images showed bilateral lung parenchyma involvement with lymph node enlargement, which was confirmed to be nonnecrotizing granuloma by pathological examination. Based on radiologic and pathological findings, he was diagnosed with sarcoidosis and was restarted on treatment with prednisone, which was continued for another 6 mo. Reexamination of chest imaging revealed complete resolution of parenchymal lung lesions and a significant reduction in the size of the mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes. Following a 6-month follow-up of completion of treatment, the patient's clinical condition remained stable with no clinical evidence of relapse. CONCLUSION This is the first case in which pulmonary sarcoidosis developed as a late complication of allopurinol-induced DRESS. The case indicated that the autoimmune reaction of DRESS may play an important role in the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis © The Author(s) 2022. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

9,Retrospective case-control study on screening risk factors of antibiotic-associated encephalopathy in patients with chronic kidney disease,"OBJECTIVE: The renal excretion function of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is reduced, and the nervous system toxic reactions of antibiotics are prone to occur. The purpose of this study is to screen out some risk factors for patients with CKD to suffer from antibiotic-associated encephalopathy (AAE). DESIGN: A case-control study. SETTING: A tertiary hospital in China. PARTICIPANTS: The medical records of patients who were hospitalised for CKD and infectious diseases in our hospital from January 2010 to December 2019. All patients used antibiotics to treat infectious diseases during hospitalisation. All patients were divided into two groups according to whether they developed AAE during hospitalisation. The patients with CKD without AAE were selected as the control group (n=120), and the patients with CKD with AAE were regarded as the AAE group (n=102). INTERVENTIONS: This study systematically analysed its clinical manifestations, laboratory examinations, prognosis, etc, and summarised the risk factors related to AAE in patients with CKD. PRIMARY OUTCOME: Screening risk factors of AAE in patients with CKD. RESULTS: Logistic regression analysis showed that coronary heart disease, as well as abnormal indicators of haemoglobin, albumin, uric acid and blood phosphorus were independent risk factors for patients with CKD with AAE (OR values were 4.137, 0.963, 0.849, 0.996 0.161, respectively, all p<0.05). The case fatality rate (Pearson χ2=7.524, p=0.006), rehospitalisation rate (Pearson χ2=6.187, p=0.013) and treatment costs (t=-8.44, p<0.001) in encephalopathy group are significantly higher than the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CKD with AAE will increase the case fatality rate and cause poor prognosis. Coronary heart disease, as well as decreased levels of haemoglobin, albumin, uric acid, and blood phosphorus are independent risk factors for patients with CKD with AAE. Timely intervention of these risk factors may reduce the incidence of AAE and improve the prognosis. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No commercial re-use.

10,Early detection of immune checkpoint inhibitor-related subclinical cardiotoxicity: A pilot study by using speckle tracking imaging and three-dimensional echocardiography,"Background: Early detection of subclinical cardiotoxicity of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy can be challenging. Objective: To evaluate subclinical cardiac dysfunction using two-dimensional speckle tracking imaging (2D-STI) and three-dimensional echocardiography in Chinese patients. Methods: Fifty-five consecutive patients with malignant tumors treated by immunotherapy were included. They were examined by echocardiography before immunotherapy and after immunotherapy. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was calculated in three-dimensional imaging. Moreover, left ventricular global longitudinal peak systolic strain (LVGLS), left ventricular global circumferential peak systolic strain (LVGCS), right ventricular global longitudinal systolic strain (RVGLS), right ventricular free wall longitudinal peak systolic strain (RVFWLS), and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) were evaluated. Clinical and laboratory parameters were recorded. Cardiac toxicity events were defined as the presence of heart failure symptoms, LVEF reduction, and increase in troponin. Subclinical cardiac toxicity was defined as cardiac dysfunction associated with ICI treatment, with absent or delayed ICI-associated cardiotoxicity clinical symptoms. Results: Compared with baseline, the LVGLS, TAPSE, and RVGLS significantly deteriorated after ICI treatment [(–18.63 ± 2.53)% vs. (–17.35 ± 2.58)%, P = 0.000; 18.29 ± 6.23 vs. 14.57 ± 3.81, P = 0.0001; and (–18.45 ± 4.65)% vs. (–14.98 ± 3.85)%, P = 0.0001, respectively]. LVGLS (–17.35 ± 2.58, P = 0.000), TAPSE (14.57 ± 3.81, P = 0.0001), and RVGLS [(–14.98 ± 3.85)%, P = 0.0001] were decreased after ICI immunotherapy. Kaplan-Meier curve analysis showed that LVGLS was more sensitive than the cardiac toxicity events to assess ICI-related subclinical cardiac dysfunction (log-rank P = 0.205). The ROC curve showed that the cutoff value of ΔLVGLS was -13%. Conclusion: Subclinical cardiac dysfunction can be detected using two-dimensional speckle-tracking imaging. LVGLS, RVGLS, and TAPSE are more sensitive indices for detection. Clinical trial registration: [https://www.chictr.org.cn/showprojen.aspx?proj=27498], identifier [ChiCTR1800016216].

11,Assessment of causal associations between uric acid and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels,"Background: Previous observational studies have revealed the association between serum uric acid and 25-hydroxyvitamin D. However, the causality and the direction of the associations remain unknown. Thus, we performed a two-sample bidirectional Mendelian Randomization (MR) analysis to investigate the causal association between uric acid and 25-hydroxyvitamin D and to determine the direction of the association. Method: Based on the summary-level GWAS data from large genome-wide association studies, several steps were taken in our analysis to select eligible single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which were strongly related to exposure as the instrumental variables. We used different analytical methods, such as inverse-variance weighting (IVW) method, weighted median, MR-Egger regression, and weighted mode method, to make our result more robust and reliable. The IVW method was used as the primary analysis. The Cochran’s Q test, MR-Egger intercept test, MR-PRESSO method, and “leave-one-out” sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the heterogeneities, horizontal pleiotropy, and robustness of the results. MR analyses were also conducted using genetic risk scores (GRS) as instrumental variables in both directions by using the same summary-level GWAS data. Results: Our two-sample MR analysis suggested a causal association of genetically predicted uric acid on 25-hydroxyvitamin D [IVW method: β(SE), −0.0352(0.0149); p = 0.0178], which suggested that a per mg/dl increase in uric acid was associated with a decrease of 0.74 nmol/L of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and the above results remained stable in the sensitivity analysis. By contrast, four MR methods suggested no causal relationship of 25-hydroxyvitamin D on serum uric acid [IVW β(SE), 0.0139 (0.0635); p = 0.826; MR-Egger β(SE), 0.0671 (0.108); p = 0.537; weighted median β(SE), 0.0933 (0.0495); p = 0.0598; weighted mode β(SE), 0.0562 (0.0463); p = 0.228, respectively]. After excluding the SNPs, which were associated with confounding factors and outlier SNPs, the IVW method suggested that there was still no causal association of 25-hydroxyvitamin D on serum uric acid. The GRS approach showed similar results. Conclusions: Serum uric acid may causally affect the 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, whereas the causal role of 25-hydroxyvitamin D on uric acid was not supported in our MR analysis. Our findings suggest that increased levels of uric acid should prompt investigation for vitamin D deficiency.

12,"Sensor performances of novel piperidine substituted cobalt(II) and copper(II) phthalocyanines for detection of dopamine, ascorbic acid and uric acid","Peripherally and non-peripherally tetra substituted cobalt(II) and copper(II) phthalocyanines were prepared and characterized via spectroscopic techniques. The electrochemical characterization of metallo-phthalocyanines were carried out to determine electrochemical behaviors. Electrochemical results of complexes were supported with the in-situ spectroelectrochemical measurements. Complexes having piperidine functional groups were electropolymerized on glassy carbon electrode surface. Sensor performances were investigated toward ascorbic acid, dopamine, uric acid. Non-peripheral cobalt(II) phthalocyanine exhibited a good linear relation in the concentration range of 1.4–60 µM with sensitivity of 0.49 µAµM−1 and low detection limit of 0.92 µM for electrochemical determination of ascorbic acid. Non-peripheral copper(II) phthalocyanine demonstrated high sensitivity (0.52 and 1.31 µAµM−1) and low detection limit (1.92 and 2.61 µM) especially for ascorbic acid and uric acid, respectively. © 2022",Electrochemical sensor; Electrochemistry; Electropolymerization; Phthalocyanines; Piperidine; Spectroelectrochemistry,Amines; Ascorbic acid; Chemical detection; Cobalt compounds; Copper compounds; Electropolymerization; Glass membrane electrodes; Neurophysiology; Spectroelectrochemistry; Dopamine; Electrochemical behaviors; Electrochemical characterizations; Electropolymerisation; Low detection limit; Phthalocyanine; Piperidine; Sensor performance; Spectroscopic technique; Uric acids; Electrochemical sensors
13,Simultaneous colorimetric detection of nephrolithiasis biomarkers using a microfluidic paper-based analytical device,"A microfluidic paper-based analytical device (μPAD) coupled with colorimetric detection was developed for simultaneous determination of urinary oxalate, citrate and uric acid (UA) which are important biomarkers of nephrolithiasis or kidney stones. The colorimetric detections were based on enzymatic reactions using oxalate oxidase and uricase for oxalate and UA, respectively, while an indicator displacement assay (IDA) using a copper murexide complex was applied for citrate detection. The developed μPAD was successfully applied for simultaneous determination of the three biomarkers in urine within 25 min, with linear ranges of 2-40, 5-150, and 5-45 mg L−1 and detection limits of 0.6, 2.9 and 3.1 mg L−1 for oxalate, UA, and citrate, respectively. The values of the percent relative standard deviation (% RSD) were lower than 6.4% for inter-day and intraday measurements of oxalate, citrate and UA standards spiked in urine samples with recovery percentages in the range of 81.0-109.8%, indicating acceptable accuracy and precision of the developed method for determination of the three biomarkers in urine samples. Accordingly, the developed μPAD holds great promise to be a simple, fast, inexpensive, low-sample and reagent volume, reliable and portable tool for simultaneous determination of oxalate, citrate and UA in urine, especially for on-site analysis. © 2023 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Biomarkers; Citrates; Citric Acid; Colorimetry; Humans; Kidney Calculi; Microfluidics; Oxalates; Uric Acid; Analytic equipment; Color; Colorimetry; Copper compounds; Diagnosis; Microfluidics; Oxalic acid; biological marker; citric acid; oxalic acid; uric acid; Citrate acid; Colorimetric detection; Enzymatic reaction; Nephrolithiasis; Oxalate oxidase; Paper-based analytical devices; Simultaneous determinations; Uric acids; Uricase; Urine sample; colorimetry; human; microfluidics; nephrolithiasis; urine; Biomarkers

15,Development and validation of a nomogram to predict the risk of peripheral artery disease in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus,"Objective: To develop and validate a nomogram for predicting the risk of peripheral artery disease (PAD) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and assess its clinical application value. Methods: Clinical data were retrospectively collected from 474 patients with T2DM at the Air Force Medical Center between January 2019 and April 2022. The patients were divided into training and validation sets using the random number table method in a ratio of 7:3. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the independent risk factors for PAD in patients with T2DM. A nomogram prediction model was developed based on the independent risk factors. The predictive efficacy of the prediction model was evaluated using the consistency index (C-index), area under the curve (AUC), receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, Hosmer-Lemeshow (HL) test, and calibration curve analysis. Additionally, decision curve analysis (DCA) was performed to evaluate the prediction model’s performance during clinical application. Results: Age, disease duration, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and hemoglobin (P<0.05) were observed as independent risk factors for PAD in patients with T2DM. The C-index and the AUC were 0.765 (95% CI: 0.711-0.819) and 0.716 (95% CI: 0.619-0.813) for the training and validation sets, respectively, indicating that the model had good discriminatory power. The calibration curves showed good agreement between the predicted and actual probabilities for both the training and validation sets. In addition, the P-values of the HL test for the training and validation sets were 0.205 and 0.414, respectively, indicating that the model was well-calibrated. Finally, the DCA curve indicated that the model had good clinical utility. Conclusion: A simple nomogram based on three independent factors–duration of diabetes, BUN, and hemoglobin levels–may help clinicians predict the risk of developing PAD in patients with T2DM.

16,Calcium isotope ratio in kidney stones: preliminary exploration of mechanism from the geochemical perspective,"Stable calcium (Ca) isotope ratios are sensitive and radiation-free biomarkers in monitoring biological processes in human bodies. Recently, the Ca isotope ratios of bone, blood, and urine have been widely reported to study bone mineral balance. However, as a pure Ca crystallization product, there is no report on the Ca isotope ratios of kidney stones, even though the prevalence of kidney stones is currently on the rise. Here, we measured Ca isotope data of 21 kidney stone samples collected in Beijing, China. The δ44/42CaNIST 915a values ranged from 0.25‰ to 2.85‰ for calcium oxalate, and from 0.38‰ to 3.00‰ and 0.61‰ to 0.69‰ for carbonate apatite and uric acid, respectively. Kidney stones have heavier Ca isotope ratios than bone or blood, which is probably because complexed Ca contains more heavy Ca isotopes than free Ca2+. Ca isotope evidence suggests that magnesium (Mg) affects kidney stone formation, as the δ44/42CaNIST 915a value is inversely correlated with the Ca/Mg ratio. This study provides important preliminary reference values on the Ca isotopic composition of kidney stones and proposes a factor influencing Ca isotope fractionation in biological processes for future research. © The Author(s) 2022.

17,Association of the serum uric acid to creatinine ratio with metabolic syndrome in the middle age and older population in China,"Background: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) has attracted great interest, with an increasing prevalence. Recent studies have shown that the serum uric acid-to-creatinine ratio (SUACr) might be an excellent biomarker for MetS risk prediction in diabetic patients and postmenopausal women. However, the relationship between SUACr and MetS in a middle-aged and older population remains unclear. Methods: A total of 1277 participants were included in this cross-sectional study. Logistic regression modelling was performed to assess the association between SUACr and MetS in the total population. The dose–response relationship of SUACr and MetS was further assessed by a restricted cubic spline model (RCS). Furthermore, to explore the relationships between the levels of SUACr and the number of metabolic components, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was applied. Results: The levels of SUACr were lower in the non-MetS participants (OR 1.60, 95% CI 1.36 to 1.89; P<0.001),. Positive and dose–response relationships were further confirmed by the RCS model. We also found that, with increased number of components, the SUACr tended to increase. Moreover, values of SUACr were strongly related to levels of triglycerides (TGs), body mass index (BMI), blood glucose levels, systolic blood pressure/diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP), and hypertension. In addition, the positive association between SUACr and MetS also occurred in those patients with normal uric acid levels. Conclusion: Elevated values of SUACr were strongly associated with an increased risk of MetS; this positive relationship remained in those individuals with normal uric acid levels.

18,"Simultaneous Determination of Ascorbic Acid, Dopamine, Uric Acid, and Acetaminophen on N, P-Doped Hollow Mesoporous Carbon Nanospheres","Dual heteroatom-doped carbon hollow spheres have attracted attention for their intriguing properties, including high surface areas, mesoporosity, sphere wall thicknesses, edge plane defect sites, catalytic active sites, and fast heterogeneous electron-transfer rates. Understandably, the material finds widespread attention in the field of electrochemical sensors. In this work, we have successfully synthesized nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) dual doped hollow mesoporous carbon spheres (NPHMCS) by a simple self-polymerization process. The effect of loading a P precursor, namely, phytic acid (PA), on the electrochemical sensing of bioanalytes is investigated in detail. The investigation revealed that 0.6 g loading of PA (NPHMCS-0.6) resulted in an enhanced surface area of 940 m2g-1, a higher pore volume of 0.40 cm3g-1, enriched defect sites of 0.99, pyridinic sites of 24.90%, and moderate P-C + P-N sites of 74.65%. The synergistic effect of nitrogen and phosphorous doping along with the abovementioned properties is taken advantage in the fabrication of electrochemical sensors for the simultaneous determination of ascorbic acid (AA), dopamine (DA), uric acid (UA), and acetaminophen (AC). The fabricated sensors displayed a wide linear range of sensing over a concentration from 5 to 6000 μM for AA, 0.5 to 2000 μM for DA, 0.5 to 5000 μM for UA, and 5 to 1200 μM for AC. Based on the calibration plot, the limits of detection (LOD) were calculated to be 0.032, 0.002, 0.005, and 0.020 μM for AA, DA, UA, and AC, respectively. The electroanalytical performance of the fabricated sensor was successfully validated for the analysis of target species in real samples. The developed methodology offers prospective advantages in clinical diagnostics for the simultaneous analysis of small biomolecules and drugs. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

19,Preoperative circulating peroxiredoxin 1 levels as a predictor of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease remission after laparoscopic bariatric surgery,"Background: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with obesity and insulin resistance and can be improved after bariatric surgery. Circulating Peroxiredoxin 1 (Prdx1) protein was reported to regulate energy metabolism and inflammation. This study aimed to investigate the roles of serum prdx1 in NAFLD patients with obesity undergoing LSG and to develop a prognostic model to predict the remission of severe NAFLD. Methods: The data of 93 participants from a tertiary hospital were assessed. Before laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and three months after LSG, anthropometric parameters, laboratory biochemical data, and abdominal B-ultrasound results were collected, and their hepatic steatosis index (HSI) and triglyceride-glucose index (TyG) were calculated. A NAFLD improvement (NAFLD-I) nomogram prediction model was constructed using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and multiple regression, and its predictive ability was verified in a validation cohort. Results: The baseline Prdx1 (OR: 0.887, 95% CI: 0.816-0.963, p=0.004), preoperative TyG (OR: 8.207, 95% CI: 1.903-35.394, p=0.005) and HSI (OR: 0.861, 95% CI: 0.765-0.969, p=0.013) levels were independently associated with NAFLD-I at three months after LSG in NAFLD patients with obesity. In the primary and validation cohorts, the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) of the developed nomogram model was 0.891 and 0.878, respectively. The preoperative circulating Prdx1 levels of NAFLD patients with obesity were significantly reduced after LSG (25.32 [18.99-30.88] vs. 23.34 [15.86-26.42], p=0.001). Prdx1 was related to obesity and hepatic steatosis based on correlation analysis. Conclusion: The nomogram based on preoperative serum prdx1, HSI and TyG could be an effective tool for predicting remission of severe NAFLD after LSG.

20,Astragaloside IV improves the pharmacokinetics of febuxostat in rats with hyperuricemic nephropathy by regulating urea metabolism in gut microbiota,"Hyperuricemic nephropathy (HN) is a common clinical complication of hyperuricemia. The pathogenesis of HN is directly related to urea metabolism in the gut microbiota. Febuxostat, a potent xanthine oxidase inhibitor, is the first-line drug used for the treatment of hyperuricemia. However, there have been few studies on the pharmacokinetics of febuxostat in HN animal models or in patients. In this study, a high-purine diet-induced HN rat model was established. The pharmacokinetics of febuxostat in HN rats was evaluated using LC-MS/MS. Astragaloside IV (AST) was used to correct the abnormal pharmacokinetics of febuxostat. Gut microbiota diversity analysis was used to evaluate the effect of AST on gut microbiota. The results showed that the delayed elimination of febuxostat caused drug accumulation after multiple administrations. Oral but not i. p. AST improved the pharmacokinetics of febuxostat in HN rats. The mechanistic study showed that AST could regulate urea metabolism in faeces and attenuate urea-ammonia liver-intestine circulation. Urease-related genera, including Eubacterium, Parabacteroides, Ruminococcus, and Clostridia, decreased after AST prevention. In addition, the decrease in pathogenic genera and increase in short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) producing genera also contribute to renal function recovery. In summary, AST improved the pharmacokinetics of febuxostat in HN rats by comprehensive regulation of the gut microbiota, including urea metabolism, anti-calcification, and short-chain fatty acid generation. These results imply that febuxostat might accumulate in HN patients, and AST could reverse the accumulation through gut microbiota regulation.
